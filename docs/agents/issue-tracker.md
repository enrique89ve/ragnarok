# Issue Tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The PRD is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/PRD.md`
- Implementation issues are `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## Publishing Work

When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker", create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`, creating the directory if needed.

## Fetching Work

When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket", read the referenced markdown path. The user will normally pass the path, feature slug, or issue number directly.

## Technical Debt Guardrail

Keep local issue files small enough for an AFK agent to execute without hidden context. If an issue needs multiple unrelated changes, split it into multiple numbered issue files.
